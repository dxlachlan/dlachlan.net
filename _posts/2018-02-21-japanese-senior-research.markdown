For my Senior Research Project for my Japanese Language & Culture Studies Major, I conducted a basic research project to understand how Japanese RPG's may have shaped the perspectives of American's in relatio to Japan and Japanese Culture. I've included both the final draft of my Japanese based paper and a copy of the presentation I gave in class.

I will soon upload an English copy of my paper.
