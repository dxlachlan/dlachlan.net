<p>After finishing his Associate's program Daniel applied to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte as a transfer student, initially applying for admissions in the College of Computing and Informatics. Once admitted he decided to pick up a Minor in Japanese Language & Culture Studies based on experiences he had in Japan during the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. However, he later chose to declare it as a second Major based on his joy of studying the language. Closing into his last year Daniel has maintained an overall 3.5 cumulative grade point average, making the dean's list multiple times, and inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa Honor Society through efforts of Scholarship and leadership in extra-curriculars both on and off campus.</p>
